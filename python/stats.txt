Examining "Date" category.


==========================

Num of true positives = 194

Num of false positives = 142

Num of false negatives = 288

Sensitivity/Recall = 0.402

PPV/Specificity = 0.6

==========================

*note: I don't think I can improve this much further without more prior knowledge.
the false negatives and positives are very difficult to filter as many of the false
positives are common descriptive values (ex: '1/3 up') and many false negatives are
written out months ('nov.') or values ('09' or '11').

Without context information and prior knowledge, it's difficult to make this more
accurate. 

Additionally, making the regex more general makes the Sensitivity and Specificity 
go upto the +90%s but the number of false positives is significantly more than 
the true positives (1400+) which would not be useful.
